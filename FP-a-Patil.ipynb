    "### Steps to perform Reading and Writing CSV file in Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "- Firstly I import sys\n",
    "\n",
    "For Read Operation:\n",
    "- Then I have created CVS and txt file in jupyter notbook, with the name \"employee_birthday.txt\", \"hrdata.csv\"\n",
    "- After that, I perform reading operation using reader object, then the CVS file opened as a text file with the help of python's build in function open(), which is return a file object. and each row returned by the reader is list of string elements, and sperated data by using delimiters.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Similary I did reading operation, with CSV file into a dictionary.\n",
    "- For dictationary we need data into key: value pair, but in our CSV file, it is not. so I specify it by my own.\n",
    "\n",
    "For Write Operation:\n",
    "- To performed write operation, I simply used writer object and .write,row() method.\n",
    "- I also used quotechar to tell writer, which character to use to quote fields when writing.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Similary, as we did read data into a dictionary, I did write from dictionary as well, and for that I used fieldname to writing a dictionary.\n",
